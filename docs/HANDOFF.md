# Current Status Recap

## What's Done
- Reviews service now uses `mongoose.Types.ObjectId` for product lookups and reliably recomputes rating aggregates after create, delete, and moderation actions.
- Inventory reservation workflow relies on `mongoose.startSession()` with graceful fallbacks when transactions are unavailable, covering reserve, release, and convert flows.
- Stripe payments guard missing configuration, provide intents when enabled, and mark orders as paid within session-backed handlers.
- Admin order APIs enforce state-machine transitions, release reservations on cancellation, and gate transaction/refund/shipment listings until orders exist.
- Automated Jest coverage spans reviews, payments, and checkout flows, and documentation/OpenAPI artifacts reflect the repaired endpoints.

## Remaining Concerns
- Automated tests skip when MongoDB is unreachable; integrate an in-memory server or ensure a live instance for CI.
- Jest still reports lingering handles—likely the shared Mongo connection—when tests exit.
- Broader follow-up items live in `docs/TODO.md` (integration suites, validation passes, additional providers).
- Monitor concurrency impact around admin initialization guards on transactions/refunds/shipments endpoints.

## Testing Gaps
- Full payment and review flow validation against a real MongoDB deployment.
- Exercising admin transaction and shipment endpoints once production data populates.
