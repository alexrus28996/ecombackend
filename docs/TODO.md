# Project Roadmap & TODOs

This list now tracks future enhancements beyond the production-ready baseline.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multi-carrier shipping providers**: integrate rate shopping and label purchase flows for UPS/FedEx alongside the existing manual shipment model.
- **Webhook retry scheduler**: persist outbound Stripe/Cloudinary webhook failures and replay with exponential backoff.
- **Advanced RBAC**: group permissions into assignable roles, add audit trails for grants, and surface per-endpoint scopes in documentation.
